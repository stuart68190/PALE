    "Now that we have some image data to feed in, we need a neural network to feed it into.  The neural network takes the image data as its input, and produces a classification as output.  The classification is the neural network's calculation of what digit it thinks the input represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is therefore 28x28 = 784 numbers, i.e. one for each pixel in the input image.  The output of the neural network is a set of 10 numbers, where each number represents the probability of the image being that digit.\n",

    "We are going to build a really simple network to start off with.  It is going to have 3 layers.  The input layer has 784 nodes - one for each input pixel.  The output layer has 10 nodes, one for each digit.  The middle layer has 5 nodes.  Every node in thee input layer is connected to each of the five middle layer nodes, and each node in the middle layer is connected to each node in the output.  This is called a fully connected network."
